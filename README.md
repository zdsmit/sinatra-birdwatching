# SinatraBirdwatching

Welcome to Sinatra Birdwatching! This project is my second portfolio project, created for Flatiron School's Online Software Engineering course. This is a simple web app that will enable users to sign up and report sightings of interesting birds in their area. I hope you enjoy!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sinatra_birdwatching'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sinatra_birdwatching

## Usage

TODO: Upon arrival at the homepage, you will need to create a user account with a password. From that point, you will be able to follow the prompts to start reporting your own bird sightings.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
